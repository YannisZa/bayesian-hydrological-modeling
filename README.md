# Bayesian hydrological modeling

This repository contains code for my mini Project on Bayesian treatment of hydrological models. 
You can read my project's report [here.](https://yannisza.github.io/research/introduction-to-bayesian-hydrological-modelling/)

## Requirements

* Python version: 3.7.5. 

You might want to create a new virtual environment using `pyenv` or `conda`. Please make sure to run `pip install -r requirements.txt` before running any piece of code.
